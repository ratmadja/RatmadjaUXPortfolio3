        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Why a reconsideration of Pandora?</h3>
        <p>I sought to improve my product intuition by taking apart an existing product in order to find certain areas where the user experience of the product can be improved. The prospect of studying a music-streaming service like Pandora and gaining insight into its user base intrigued me because it is a service that I rarely use and thus better equipped to make an objective evaluation of.</p>
        <p class="p-italic">Please note that this design exercise was not solicited by Pandora. All product observations, heuristic evaluations, and design opinions are my own and does not reflect the views of Pandora.</p>

        <h2>Design process</h2>
        <p>First, I evaluated the current state of the product by defining the value propositions of the app through an understanding of its user base. This was achieved by finding patterns in the most helpful user reviews in the app store. Second, I identified three key pain points and explain why there is a need to resolve them. Last but not least, I did a partial redesign the Pandora app interface to address the three pain points I identified.</p>

        <h4 class="note-label">Pandora—a product redesign exercise</h4>
        <h2 class="pullquote">My reconsideration of the Pandora radio app focuses on giving users greater control over their radio-listening experience and reducing friction in the music-discovery experience.</h2>


        <p>Here is a preview of the proposed redesign:</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Pandora’s value propositions</h2>
        <p>I validated Pandora’s main value propositions by combing through 24 real-life user reviews from the ‘Ratings and Reviews’ section of the app store. I also conducted two user interviews—one with a Pandora user and one with a user of Spotify (Pandora’s chief competitor).</p>
        <p>After identifying patterns in the data I gathered, I validated that the following are the chief value propositions that the Pandora music app offers:</p>
        <h4>“A personalized music experience that evolves with your taste.”</h4>
        <h4>“Easily create custom radio stations based on an artist or song that you love.”</h4>
        <h4>“Actively control your listening experience through a ‘thumbs’ feedback system.”</h4>

        <h2>Understanding Pandora’s user base</h2>
        <p>After combing through 20+ user reviews and conducting 2 user interviews,  I was able to gather enough data to detect patterns in users’ behaviors and mindset—enough to paint a picture of Pandora’s existing user base.</p>

        <figcaption>A snapshot of my notes as I sift for patterns in user reviews and interviews to find some shared characteristics unique to the Pandora user base.</figcaption>


        <h2>A profile of Pandora’s user base</h2>
        <p>Further analysis of user feedback and testing the Pandora app for myself yielded more insights into the shared behavioral traits and characteristics that distinguish Pandora’s existing user base.</p>


        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Insight 1</h5>
            <h4>They want ‘controlled variety’ in their music-listening experience.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>A binary “thumbs system” is conducive for creating homogenous playlists that are unfriendly to variety. User feedbacks indicate that unpredictability in how the station algorithm responds discourages them from disliking or liking a variety song for fear of ruining their stations.</p>


        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Insight 2</h5>
            <h4>Discovery of new music and artists are a critical part of their enjoyment of the app.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Pandora users are looking to discover new artists to diversify their playlists. The joy of discovering new artists with similarities to their favorites is a frequent praise for the app.</p>


        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Insight 3</h5>
            <h4>They want new artists and music to find them.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Pandora users exhibit a passive approach towards music discovery. This group does not actively seek out new music as they outsource that task to an algorithm.</p>


        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Insight 4</h5>
            <h4>They listen while multi-tasking or in-transit.</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Pandora users tend to listen to music concurrently with another task that occupies their primary attention. Most use cases involve users who are in-transit, studying, or working.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="p-italic">“I disliked a song because I did not like the artist. That ruined the chemistry of my station and forced me to start over from scratch.”</p>
          <p>The inability to predict the outcome of “thumbing down” a song is a steady source of pain among users. Currently, the binary system of “thumbs up or down” does not distinguish between disliking a song, an artist, or an entire musical genre.</p>
          <p>This is the most severely-felt pain point in a user base that values personal control over their radio-listening experience. This is also a breach in a critical value proposition of Pandora.</p>

          <p class="p-italic">“I did not realize that I have to conduct a search for the artist in order to start a new radio station.”<p>
          <p>The low discoverability of top-level hierarchies and critical features that support the music-discovery experience causes users to miss out. Critical notifications, social feed updates, and settings are all hidden inside a catch-all hamburger menu.</p>
          <p>Moreover, users must conduct an artist search in order to start a radio station. This counter-intuitive flow  presents a barrier of learning that may frustrate new users, who may just give up and take their businesses elsewhere.</p>

          <div class="img2upflip-container">

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">

          <p class="p-italic">“I wish I don’t have to jump to Youtube to see more music by this artist and share their songs to my friends.”</p>
          <p>Pandora’s interface makes it difficult for users to make a personal connection with artists and to share their discovery with friends—because doing so forces them to switch platforms, thereby interrupting their listening enjoyment.</p>
          <p>There are also many barriers to artist discovery (such as lackluster artist bios that omit artist’s discography) that force users to switch to a different platform to find more information, which introduces the risk that Pandora users may just take their business elsewhere.</p>

          <h2>Discovering the real problems</h2>
          <p>To further empathize with Pandora’s user base and validate the existence of these pain points, I explored the Pandora radio app for myself. Experiencing the pain points personally and acquainting myself with the Pandora app environment enabled me to discern the true origins of these pain points.</p>

          </div>
          <h3>Pain point 3—</h3>

          <h3>Origin of pain point 3—</h3>
          <p>A personalized music discovery experience that is impersonal and leaves little room for sharing</p>


          <h2>Design goals</h2>
          <p>Identifying the origins of users’ pain points enable me to define the high-level design goals for the revised UI design to address the three user pain points.</p>
