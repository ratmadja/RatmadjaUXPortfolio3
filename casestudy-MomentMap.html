          <h4 class="note-label">June 13, 2020</h4>
          <h2 class="pullquote">We are entering a new design era.</h2>

          <p>Have you noticed that the new ways with which we live, work, and play are now event-driven as opposed to process-driven?</p>
          <p>Our daily lives are augmented by AI-powered services that respond to our needs. Digital assistants like Alexa learn our purchase habits to remind us to replenish our pantries. Netflix’s machine-learning algorithm curates our watchlist and influences our pop-culture references. While Google’s search engine prioritizes results that we are most likely to view at the top, thereby influencing which sources we come to rely on time and time again.</p>
          <p>As an Experience Designer, I cannot help but notice that human-to-machine interactions via the intermediary of clickable interfaces have begun to noticeably decline. We have near-instaneous interactions between human and machine as new AI-powered services operate beyond clickable interfaces. With the rise of AI , the “face” of the machine is starting to disintegrate, leaving us to interact directly with a machine intelligence that behaves less like an automaton—and more like an entity who can practically read our minds through data.</p>
          <p>The implication of this new era for Experience Designers is that we are shifting from designing for a process-driven world, to designing for an event-driven world—where our needs drive the AI as much as the AI drives our actions in the physical world. </p>

          <h2>What is missing in this picture?</h2>
          <p>Despite all the advances in AI, the only languages available in the marketplace to communicate intent are the language of mathematical algorithms, statistical analysis, and code. These are actually implementation languages that point towards intent, but not the intent in itself.</p>
          <h2 class="pullquote">There is no language for the Designer to write an intelligent entity into existence from the starting point of empathy.</h2>
          <p>The Moment Map is a framework that I’ve created to do just this. Its purpose is to empower every Experience Designer to capture human life-goals as ‘key moments’ that teams of Data Engineers and Scientists can translate into services or responses powered by mathematical algorithms.</p>
          <p>As a framework that acts as a bridge between experience design and data science, the wordings of the Moment Map are by design a combination of the languages from both worlds.  The key moments are deliberately articulated in the human language of empathy, while the data-reading events are articulated in the machine language of implementation.</p>


          <h2>Data is in service to human life goals</h2>
          <p>The Moment Map positions the power of AI in relation to the human life goals it serves. This framework lends itself as a shared language to enable cross-functional teams to design AI-powered services from the starting point of empathy.</p>
          <h3>Framing human life goals as key moments is the start</h3>
          <p>Life goals are expressed as Key Moments that represent a change in a person’s state of mind or a shift in perspective. For instance, if we’re designing for a key moment when a person feels empowered to live a full life even while diagnosed with a chronic illness—how might we know when a person has reached that key moment through the reading of data?</p>
          <h3>Sensing context to determine the best response</h3>
          <p>In order for an AI entity to respond best to the Customer's needs, it will need to be able to take the Customer's situation and unique life context into account. knowing what goal to steer the user towards will influence the course of action taken by the AI entity in order to nudge the person towards that life goal.</p>

            <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Definition</h1>
          </div>


          <h2>The basic unit is a Moment Tower</h2>

          <p>AI-powered services consist of a series of moments where the AI entity senses the person’s needs through the reading of data, so that it can respond in a way that is appropriate to the person’s life context. A Moment Tower perfectly captures these “sense and respond” mode of thinking for AI-powered services. </p>
          <p>Mapping life-goals in relation to the moments where the AI senses the person’s needs through the reading of data enables the AI entity to take the person’s unique life context into account and respond appropriately.</p>
          <p>A Moment Tower consists of three primary building blocks, they are the Key Moment, the Conditions for Satisfaction (for a moment to be considered achieved), and the AI Response Modules. </p>
          <p>For instance, a Moment Tower for the design of an AI Assistant that helps Patients manage diabetes might look like this:</p>

          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img class="img-boxshadow" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentTower.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>


          <h2>A series of Moment Towers make up a Moment Map</h2>

          <p>Because a Moment Tower represents a person’s life-goal instead of an end-task goal, Designers now have the freedom to design moments that a customer can experience in the sequence that best meets their needs. </p>

          <p class="p-italic">For instance, a Moment Map capturing one patient’s Key Moments in their journey to thrive even with a diagnosis for a chronic illness might look like this:</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentMapType1A.svg" alt="">
          </div>

          <p class="p-italic">For another patient, their journey might look like this:</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentMapType1B.svg" alt="">
          </div>

          <p class="p-italic">Perhaps through research, you learned that it is best to design the patient's journey to health to occur in a sequential fashion. In that case, the patient’s journey may look like this:</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentMapType2.svg" alt="">
          </div>

          <p class="p-italic">If you already have a Mental Model Framework, you can easily substitute a Task Tower with a Moment Tower:</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentMapType3.svg" alt="">
          </div>

          <h3>So how did we get here?</h3>
          <p>Let's briefly revisit the situational context that inspired the creation of this framework.</p>

            <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Context</h1>
          </div>

          <h2>The trouble with task-oriented tools in an event-driven world</h2>
          <p>As an Experience Designer in the Finance Technology space, I grapple with unpredictability in our customers’ financial journeys on a daily basis. Therefore it was with great irony that I tried to create some measure of predictability by portraying the customer experience as a linear journey—with a starting point and an endpoint. It was my Product Partner who pointed out the fact that our customer journey was anything but linear. We were trying to capture a non-linear journey in an artifact that is designed to capture sequential, task-based processes, and it was not yielding the complete picture.</p>
          <p>It would be several months later when the limitation of task-based experience maps would come back to confound my mentor and I. We were both hitting similar walls where our experience maps prove unequal to the task of designing experiences with non-sequential stages, where the order by which a customer experiences each stage will vary due to situational and/or  contextual factors that would vary.</p>
          <p>Imagine a scenario where the next stage of the customer journey is influenced by the life contexts unique to each customer. And then layer the behavioral variables that influence the customer’s decisions as to where they will proceed on top of that. This scenario exposes the limitation of task-oriented mapping artifacts in capturing event-driven experiences where the customer journey is non-sequential.</p>
          <p>A customer journey map may be a great framework for capturing experiences that can be broken down to predictable process steps towards a known job-to-be-done. But what happens when the job-to-be-done changes due to unforeseen life circumstances? </p>

          <p>This question really points towards the larger question of:</p>
          <h2 class="pullquote">How might we design for unpredictability in the human experience?</h2>
          <p>When the customer journey is driven by a funnel-like process, the journey has a finite number of paths. But when the customer journeys are driven by the changing needs of the customer, the journey has a near-infinite possibilities of paths. </p>

          <h2>Mapping goals instead of tasks</h2>
          <p>I found that it was more effective to design for unpredictability by focusing on key moments that matter most to customers, rather than to anticipate every possible scenario that may or may not happen.</p>
          <p>When we thought of the customer journey as a sequence of steps, we were bound by the sequential nature of tasks that led us to anticipate every possible decision point in the customer journey. Mapping key moments instead of the tasks frees us from accounting for scenarios that may or may not happen, and to instead focus on the pivotal moments where the customer experiences a shift in mindset or perspective.</p>
          <p>Tasks are driven by process requirements, but moments are driven by customer needs. The outcome of mapping sequential stages in a customer journey  is a scripted experience that behaves more like a funnel than a journey. The outcome of mapping Key Moments is an experience where customers are free to choose the path that is best for them rather than forcing the customer through a funnel.</p>
          <p>Because the Moment Map is a framework that can handle changes in the job-to-be-done of the customer at any point in the customer journey, it is particularly suited as a framework for designing smart, AI-powered services.</p>

          <div class="label-container">
            <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Principles</h1>
          </div>


          <p>Before we get to the building blocks of a Moment Map, here are some guiding principles in designing customer-need-driven experiences with the Moment Map.</p>

          <h2>Key moments are life-goals, not end-task goals</h2>
          <p>A goal at its highest level is intangible in nature and they are often expressed as thoughts (realizations) and feelings.  The best way to articulate a key moment is to describe the thoughts and feeling that the customer has when that moment is achieved.</p>
          <p>Here are a few examples of how to frame a moment:</p>

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">The Moment when I...</h5>
            <h4>Realize that the cost of inaction is higher than the cost of taking action.</h4>
            <h4>Realize that I have the power to change my situation.</h4>
            <h4>Feel empowered to make a life-changing decision.</h4>
            <h4>Feel hopeful in getting back on track after a relapse.</h4>
            <h4>Believe that I can successfully make a change.</h4>
          </div>
          <p>A machine can not understand these intangible sentiments. It just understands what a person is feeling or thinking through that person's behavioral data. So when we design the AI responses, we need to train the AI entity how to infer human thoughts and mental states through the reading of data.</p>


          <h2>We are designing an entity</h2>
          <p>The subtle-yet-critical nuance in designing smart, AI-powered services is that we are designing an entity that is capable of making judgment calls based on the reading of data. It is also capable of taking service actions on behalf of a human should we authorize it to.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">In order to determine what customer data is needed by the AI to take action, we must first understand the categories of actions that the AI will undertake once it processes the customer data. Unsurprisingly, these categories of actions mirror what a thoughtful, helpful, and kind human being would do on behalf of another.</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/DataRead1.svg" alt="">
          </div>
          <p class="p-italic">Here are several categories of data or information that the AI will need to "read" in order to decide the next best course of action it will take. There are as many categories as there are action categories one can think of. I find that the categories below is a great starting point that covers most situations.</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/DataRead2.svg" alt="">
          </div>
          <p class="p-italic">The data category will then drive the action category taken by the AI entity:</p>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/DataRead3.svg" alt="">

          <div class="label-container">
            <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Synthesis</h1>
          </div>


          <p>A Moment Tower consists of three primary building blocks, they are the Key Moment, the Conditions for Satisfaction (for a moment to be considered achieved), and the AI Response Modules.</p>

          <h3>Building block 1: the key moment</h3>
          <p>The best way to articulate a key moment is to describe the  feelings or thoughts that customers have when that moment is achieved. For example, let’s say that we are designing an AI-powered assistant to help patients manage their chronic diabetes. The customer in this case is a Patient who is struggling to manage their diabetic symptoms. A key moment in this customer’s experience might be:</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img class="img-boxshadow" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentTowerBlock1.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Building block 2: the condition for satisfaction</h3>
          <p>A machine doesn’t think or feel about human ideals, it just understands where the human is emotionally and mentally through data. It falls to us to quantify for the machine what data points to read in order to understand where the human is in their journey towards their goal. I find it effective to format the condition for success like this:</p>

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Condition for satisfaction</h5>
            <h4>Reading of [data category that signals success]</h4>
            <h4>indicates that [desired outcome] is occurring.</h4>
          </div>

          <p>For our Patient whose life goal is to live fully despite a chronic condition, a condition for satisfaction might be:</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img class="img-boxshadow" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentTowerBlock2.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Building block 3: categories of the AI’s responses</h3>
          <p>Each condition of success correlates to an ‘AI response module,’ which consists of a 3 categorical ways that an AI entity responds to data readings. The AI Assistant reads the data it gathers from the customer. Based on where the data reading falls in relation to the condition for success, the AI will respond accordingly. The actions taken by the AI in response to reading the data fall under 3 categories: execute an action on behalf of a human, escalate the event to the human’s attention, or outsource an action to another entity (be they another human, AI, or system. I find it effective to format the AI’s responses like this:</p>

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Format for the AI Response Module</h5>
            <h4>Reading of [data category] triggers an [event category] where:</h4>
            <h4>If [situation conveyed by data], then execute [action] on behalf of human.</h4>
            <h4>If [situation conveyed by data], then escalate [event] to human's attention.</h4>
            <h4>If [situation conveyed by data], then outsource [action or event] to another entity (another human, AI, or system).</h4>
          </div>

          <p>In our example of the Patient’s condition for success being her adherence to the doctor’s prescribed medication regiment, the AI responses to the reading of her medication data might be:</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img class="img-boxshadow" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentTowerBlock3.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">A Moment Tower at its simplest form has 3 components:</h5>
            <h4>The key moment where a human achieves a desired outcome.</h4>
            <h4>The condition for satisfaction that quantifies for the AI the data that indicates that the moment has been achieved.</h4>
            <h4>The AI responses to various data readings </h4>
          </div>

          <p class="p-italic">A Moment Tower for our patient can look like this:</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img class="img-boxshadow" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/MomentTower.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Scaling the Moment Tower</h2>

          <p>A Moment Tower can have 1 or more conditions for satisfaction. Each condition for satisfaction correlates to an AI Response Module, where the AI entity "reads" the behavioral data to decide between 3 categories of actions.</p>
          <p>The 3 action categories include: execute action on behalf of the person, escalate to the human, and outsource the event/action to another entity (be they human, system, or another AI entity).</p>

          <p>Here is what a Key Moment Tower with two conditions for success can look like. Notice how each condition for satisfaction ladders up to the Patient's key moment:</p>

            <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csMomentMap/images/Scale_MomentTowerSingle.svg" alt="">
          </div>


          <h2>The many ways to construct a Moment Map</h2>

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">A Moment Map can be made of a series of Key Moments that can occur in any sequence</h5>

            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">A Moment Map can also consist of Key Moments that happen in sequence</h5>
            <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">A key moment can also be inserted as a tower within a Mental Space</h5>

          </div>


          <h2>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h2>
          <p class="p-italic">The Moment Map would not be possible without the work of several thought leaders whose work I have read and internalized in my journey to grow as an Experience Designer.</p>
          <p>In creating this framework, I drew ideas and inspiration from Alan Cooper’s Goal-Directed Design, Indi Young’s Mental Models, and Adaptive Path’s Experience Mapping Methods. Alan Cooper’s goal-directed persona inspired me to map a series of goals instead of tasks. The way with which Indi Young describes the tasks in her mental model framework as more than just an action enabled me to look at the higher goals beyond an end-task goal. Adaptive Path’s Experience Mapping inspired me to bridge design intent with a series of ‘data actors’ that operate behind-the-scenes.</p>
          <p>I am especially grateful for the encouragement of my mentor Terry Ribb,  who inspired me to develop this framework in the first place. The Moment Map is the first of several tools I will be working on to empower Designers to build experiences in this new era of data-driven smart services, and I look forward to evolving this framework as it is put into practice.</p>
