        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Introduction</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I am Rachel Atmadja, an Interaction Designer with roots in architectural design—I craft meaningful experiences that remind us of our humanity.</h3>
        <p>I received my <a class="link-work" target="_blank" href="studioArch.html">design education</a> from the School of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and worked professionally as an architectural designer for six years. <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://www.kearch.com/">Koning Eizenberg Architecture</a> is the last architectural studio I had the honor to join.</p>
        <p>The decision to transition from the architectural to the digital landscape was driven by the realization in order to design systems that interact with people at a more relational level, it was creatively necessary that I shift from designing the tectonics of static building systems to designing the behavior of responsive digital systems. Motivated by this powerful insight, I entered into formal apprenticeships under two seasoned mentors, and I have been designing and building digital products and experiences ever since.</p>
        <p>At present, I am a Senior Interaction Designer working on the design of services and digital products at Capital One. I adopt an empathetic posture to innovation that is rooted in a deep understanding of the customer’s lived experience. This approach has shaped the human-centered perspective that I bring to the design of enterprise services and digital platforms. This has also enabled me to effectively advocate for the true needs of the customer during product discovery and delivery.</p>
        <p>My areas of focus include facilitating alignment within cross-functional teams and synthesizing qualitative research insights that elevate the design-thinking of the innovation team leadership. Ultimately, my goal is to deliver seamless experiences with a focus on outcome over output.</p>
        <p>All in all, it turns out I never really stopped building things.</p>


        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What motivates you to do great work?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">A large part of my work as a Designer, is having the ability to discern where people are struggling, and where people are being excluded from opportunities for a better way to live, work, and play.</h3>
        <p>My goal as a designer is for people to feel seen and heard in my work. Nothing makes me happier than designing tools that enable people to accomplish far more than what they thought they were capable of accomplishing. Strategizing and designing products that truly make a difference at a personal and relational level is what makes pushing design solutions forward in the face of doubt and uncertainty worth it for me.</p>

        <p>As an architectural designer, I was part of the cross-functional design and engineering teams behind the

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What do you do outside of work?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote">I still build things.</h3>
        <p>I sketched, prototyped, and constructed  a line of table <a href="studioFurn.html" class="link-work" target="_blank">furniture</a> inspired by architectural hardware pieces and other objects of industry. To put my <a href="studioFloristry.html" class="link-work" target="_blank" >floral design</a> skills to good use, I arrange bridal bouquets for friends and took orders for mother’s day floral arrangements.</p>
        <p>When I'm not building things, I thoroughly enjoy deepening my understanding of various subjects, ranging from caring for houseplants to cultivating resiliency in life. My solo projects include synthesizing a
          <a target="_blank" class="link-ref" href="https://rachelatmadja.com/casestudy-MomentMap.html">framework to design artificial intelligence (AI) entities from the starting point of empathy</a>
          , and learning to paint the innovation landscape.</p>
