        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Introduction</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">I’m Rachel Atmadja—a digital product designer with roots in architectural design.</h3>
        <p>I received my <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="studioArch.html">design education</a> from the School of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and worked professionally as an architectural designer for several firms in the Los Angeles area. <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://www.kearch.com/">Koning Eizenberg Architecture</a> was the last architectural studio I had the honor to join.</p>
        <p>Six years into my architectural career, I made the decision to shift mediums and transition into digital product design. The reason for my transition is the near impossibility of designing systems that interact with people at a relational level—through the medium of building materials. It became creatively necessary that I shift from designing the tectonics of static building systems, to designing the behavior of responsive digital systems.</p>
        <p>And so the adventure begins. I entered into a formal apprenticeship under two seasoned mentors and honed my craft in UX/UI and Product Design. I have been designing and building digital products ever since. It turns out I never really stopped building things after all.</p>


        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Which buildings did you work on?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">I am proud to have been an integral part of the architecture and engineering teams behind the <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://www.hksinc.com/places/u-s-bank-stadium-minnesota-vikings-2/">U.S. Bank (Vikings) Stadium</a>, the <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://www.hksinc.com/places/camp-pendleton-replacement-hospital-2/">Naval Hospital at Camp Pendleton</a>, and a <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://www.hksinc.com/places/jasper/">residential high-rise at San Francisco</a>.

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What would you like to work on?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">Designing experiences and building digital products that empower underserved and marginalized user groups are close to my heart.</h3>
        <p>I believe that designers are uniquely positioned to make people feel seen and heard by the works of our hands. I think that designing excellent products that specifically meet someone's needs is a powerful way to dignify that person's experience—no matter what life circumstances he or she may have gone through.</p>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Why are you a designer?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">Growing up, I was mesmerized by the beauty and precision of systems.</h3>
        <p>More specifically, the way repetitive kits-of-parts can be combined in endless permutations to create different structures that serve specific purposes.</p>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/about/images/about3.png" />
        <p>My brother told me that when we were kids, he distinctly remembered me pushing away Barbie dolls and reaching for the boxes of Lego’s. </p>
        <p>My parents saw that I had an aptitude for building things and encouraged it. While most dads would buy their little daughters easy-bake ovens and stuffed animals, my dad bought me the lego set of a medieval fortress, complete with a drawbridge.</p>
        <p>It came with the most beautiful construction manual I have ever seen: an exploded axonometric drawing of the castle where I could see how every single lego component combine to form the superstructure. It was perfectly rendered with the appropriate line weights to communicate depth and hierarchy  to six-year-old me.</p>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">Ultimately, it was this fascination with beauty and utility that led me to pursue design as a profession.</h3>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">Why did you transition from architecture to product design?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">In order to impact people at an emotional and relational level, I needed to shift from designing the <span>tectonics</span> of static building systems—to designing the <span>behavior</span> of responsive digital systems.</h3>
        <p>After six years of solving tectonic problems in building systems, I realized that although the scale of buildings enable architects to shape the way people interact with their physical environments, the creative outputs (magnificent buildings as they are) tend to be immutable objects—they act as constants that are immune to almost all manner of change.</p>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/about/images/about2.png" />
        <p>Buildings tend to be impersonal in the sense that there is no real dialogue between it and its occupants. Perhaps it is no accident that great architecture are often described as a beautiful, <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="https://archidose.blogspot.com/2015/11/peter-zumthor-different-kinds-of-silence.html">different kind of silence</a>.</p>
        <p>I found that the closest thing to a personal dialogue that humans can have with designed systems is in the realm of human-computer interaction, where a responsive digital system responds to something as personal as a touch of a finger or a human voice.</p>

        <h5 class="about-sectionlabel">What do you do outside of work?</h5>
        <h3 class="pullquote26h">I still build things.</h3>
        <p>I sketched, prototyped, and constructed  a line of table <a href="studioFurn.html" class="link-ref" target="_blank">furniture</a> inspired by architectural hardware pieces and other objects of industry. I also practice floral-arranging in my spare time. To put my <a href="studioFloristry.html" class="link-ref" target="_blank" >floral design</a> skills to good use, I arrange bridal bouquets for friends and took orders for mother’s day floral arrangements.</p>
        <p>Objects that are simultanenously beautiful and useful fascinate me. I recently began appreciating the microscopic beauty of letterforms. It turns out I have a fondness for serifed typefaces with classical proportions. </p>
