        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Ingrain is a plant-based, meal-planning app for people who wish to transition to plant-based eating to improve their health. Ingrain personalizes the meal-planning experience by creating recipe suggestions based on your preference in food cuisine, taste, and texture. For each recipe, Ingrain will flag the allergens and food dislikes you specify on your profile. A food tracker allows you to log your progress towards a daily food servings recommendation that is calculated based on your gender, height, and weight.</p>
        <h4>On a personal note</h4>
        <p class="p-italic">As someone living with Type-2 diabetes, the conntection between food and health is an area I am passionate about. Designing this meal-planning app to help people heal their bodies with food parallels my own transition to plant-based eating to reverse my diabetes diagnosis.</p>
        <h3>A case study in three parts</h3>
        <p>I broke down the design process behind ingrain into three succinct parts. This second part explains the evolution of the user interface design from low to high-fidelity, and the user feedback that led me to change the art direction to increase legibility of content.</p>

        <h2 class="pullquote">This is a story of putting usability ahead of expressivity—by ruthlessly editing my work to a level of simplicity that optimizes content legibility.</h2>
        <p class="p-italic">Here is a peek at the final design of the app screens:</p>

        <h5 class="section-sublabel">Conveying object relationships with motion</h5>
        <h2>The granular nature of motion design</h2>
        <p>Drawing upon resources such as <a class="link-ref" href="https://medium.com/ux-in-motion/creating-usability-with-motion-the-ux-in-motion-manifesto-a87a4584ddc">Issara Willenskomer’s 12 Principles of UX in Motion</a> and <a class="link-ref" href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-ultimate-guide-to-proper-use-of-animation-in-ux-10bd98614fa9">Taras Skytskyi’s Ultimate guide to proper use of animation in UX</a>,  I learned the motion design principles behind the great interactions that enhance usability and content legibility with motion design. In particular, I learned to select the appropriate type of object movements that guide the user’s attention to the right place at the right time, and how to avoid jarring movements that look unnatural to the human eye.</p>
        <h3>Choose wisely and apply consistently</h3>
        <p>Drawing upon these motion design principles, I created a set of rules concerning which movement types to utilize for specific element transitions. A key consideration in choosing the movement type is that it must direct the user’s attention to the task at hand, thereby supporting the app’s usability.</p>
        <p class="p-italic">Here is a break down of the movement types within the ingrain meal-planning app and a short summary of their use cases within the app interactions:</p>

        <h5 class="section-sublabel">Designing in-between screens</h5>
        <p>I took the liberty of taking a cross section of interaction details that are representative of ingrain's interactions. Each interaction is deconstructed into a series of animation curves that govern the movement of major elements during each sequence.</p>
        <h2>Real-time interactions</h2>
        <p class="p-italic" >To borrow from <a target="_blank" class="link-ref" href="http://uxinmotion.net/">Issara Willenskomer</a>'s terminologies, interactions are classified as real-time interactions when it occurs concurrently with input from users. Here are four representative samples of this type of interaction with in the app:</p>

        <h5 class="section-sublabel">Creating narrative with motion</h5>
        <p>In constructing these interactive prototypes, my gratitude goes out to <a target="_blank" class="link-ref" href="http://uxinmotion.net/">Issara Willenskomer</a> for his in-depth articles on the principles of motion design—they were instrumental in teaching me to go beyond designing screen to screen and to think temporally as I design the in-between states of objects in transition.</p>
        <p>I walked away with a greater understanding of the motion design principles that are agnostic to design tools and medium and became convinced of the value that motion design can add to elevate an interaction from a good to a great experience. Whether it is to keep them focused on a task, or to communicate the relationship between objects.</p>
