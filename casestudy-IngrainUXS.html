          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Ingrain is a plant-based, meal-planning app that was conceived as a response to the diabetes epidemic that is presently ravaging North America. Its purpose is to equip those who often feel as though they’re at the mercy of a chronic disease like diabetes—to reverse their diagnosis with plant-based foods.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">On a personal note—as someone living with Type-2 diabetes, the connection between food and health hits close to home for me. Luckily, my mentor <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://terrymillion.com/">Terry Million</a> is passionate about this subject as well. I am extremely grateful to him for his guidance and encouragement throughout the design process.</p>

          <h3>A case study in three parts</h3>
          <p>This is Part 1 of 2 in the Ingrain case study series. This first part covers the research and user insights that led me to redefine the MVP. The same insights became the basis for structuring the content of a product page to maximize user engagement.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">Curious as to how the strategy is applied during the UI and interaction design process?</p>

            <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Research</h1>
          </div>

          <h2>Why address a diabetes epidemic with a meal planning app? </h2>
          <p>From the start, Ingrain is about drawing the connection between food and medicine. The predominant approach of treating diabetes and other chronic diseases has been to manage rather than reverse the disease. The design of apps for diabetic persons have mirrored this approach by focusing on providing disease-managing tools such as logbooks to monitor blood sugar levels.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">Rather than focusing on managing the disease, Ingrain focuses on the person by empowering them to eradicate it for good through a diet of plant-based and whole foods.</p>

          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/mindseta.svg" />
            </div>
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/mindsetb.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>


          <figcaption>A paradigm shift from simply managing a disease to eradicating the disease</figcaption>
          <p>Rather than providing tools to manage a disease, Ingrain provides the tools to help people heal their bodies by providing free access to high quality recipes that are based on accurate nutrition information and personalizing the meal-planning experience to the user’s needs.</p>
          <p>Ingrain’s plant-based approach to eating builds upon the researches done by American physicians Dr. Rip Esselstyn and Dr. Neal Barnard on preventing and reversing heart diseases and diabetes with plant-based eating (as documented on the Netflix documentary Forks over Knives). As well as Dr. Michael Greger’s research into the harmful effects of consuming animal products.</p>


          <h2>The first pivot</h2>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">

          </div>
          <p class="p-italic">Although Ingrain grew to become a plant-based meal-planning app, it didn’t start out that way. Originally, I set out to design a gamified nutrition education app for youth with diabetes. However, given the time constraint of the project, going through the process of obtaining permission to interview and conduct user-testings prove too significant of a barrier to overcome. At that juncture, I shifted the project scope to be a gamified nutrition education app targeted towards adults ages 18 to 30.</p>

          <h2>Validating assumptions of the users' mental models</h2>
          <p>My initial research findings unearthed several insights into the mental model of my target audience, enabling me to form educated assumptions about their attitudes towards healthy-eating. I proceeded to validate these assumptions by deploying a survey to gage the target audience's perception of healthy eating and conducting interviews to assess young adults' attitudes towards the relationship between food and health.</p>

          </div>
          <p>When participants were asked to rank 12 foods in order of health, the top 3 spots are taken by plant-based foods. But the belief that fish and chicken are healthier meats compared to beef  still persists.</p>

          <p class="p-italic">After analyzing the results of my user survey and interviews, I realized that no amount of nutrition education will convince an unmotivated or willfully-ignorant person that their poor dietary choices are on a collision course with their health.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">This insight led me to shift ingrain’s target user group. Instead of trying to convince unmotivated young adults to eat healthily through a gamified nutrition education app— ingrain will instead empower people who have made the decision to transition to plant-based, whole foods.</p>

          </div>


          <h2>Analyzing the competition</h2>
          <p>I studied several competitors to study how they position themselves in the marketplace and understand their business models.</p>


          <h3>Model 1—The vertically-integrated meal-delivery kit providers</h3>
          <p>The first model is that of meal-planning apps that are connected to a vertically-integrated meal kit delivery service. Services such as the ChooseVeg Meal Planner and the Jay-Z & Beyonce-endorsed 22 Days of Nutrition follow this model. They allow users to personalize their meal plans by asking questions about the user’s availability to meal-prep and suggesting recipes that fit their schedule.</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor1.png" />

          </div>
          <figcaption>Chooseveg and 22 Days of Nutrition—the vegan vertically-integrated meal kit delivery models</figcaption>


          <h3>Model 2—The traffic funnels</h3>
          <p>The second model is that of meal-planing apps that function as traffic funnels that direct users towards a brand’s website, usually  to get users to purchase their products or services. A great example is the Forks over Knives’ mealplanner app, which funnels users to the parent site where users can sign up to get certified in plant-based cooking. Oh She Glows is an app that serves as an extension of the author Angela Liddon’s cooking blog, where users can access more recipes and purchase her cookbook.</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">
            <div class="img2upflip">
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor3.png" />

              <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor4.png" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <figcaption>Forks Over Knives and Oh-She-Glows—meal-planning apps that function as traffic funnels to the author’s website.</figcaption>


          <h3>Model 3—The community recipe site</h3>
          <p>A third model focuses on serving the user by providing them with free access to their curated recipe content. Their revenue stream came through product-placement. The result is a crisp, user-focused cooking app that is not trying to sell products to users. The best example of this is the Berlin-based cooking app Kitchen Stories. They offer users free access to its curated recipe content. Giving users ability to save, share, and rate their content gives them useful traffic information and promotes a sense of community among users.</p>
          <img class="img-1up" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor5.png" />
          <figcaption>Kitchen Stories—the community-based recipe site that caters to cooks of all levels.</figcaption>


          <h2>It became clear that Ingrain should follow the community-recipe-site model and be the “Kitchen Stories from a plant-based perspective.”</h2>


          <p>I then proceeded to take a closer look at the structure and interface of three recipe apps that best reflect the plant-based ethos in their interface. They are Kitchen Stories, Oh She Glows, and the Forks Over Knives Meal Planner app.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">Here is a breakdown of what each app does best:</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Kitchen Stories</h5>
          </div>
          <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-ks.png" />
          <p class="p-italic">Kitchen Stories has the cleanest and tightest information architecture that I have ever seen in recipe apps.</p>
          <p>This is accomplished by limiting user engagement with content (e.g. like, save, share) to the smallest unit of information (a recipe article). A featured kitchen story is never more than two levels deep. This allows for that third-level of depth to be occupied by how-to-videos and step-by-step prep instructions.</p>
          <p>It does a great job of encouraging user engagement with content by liking, saving, and commenting—without diluting the consistency of the brand.</p>
          <p>It has a netflix-like approach to presenting content that encourage users to explore and browse recipe content at their pace.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Oh She Glows</h5>
          </div>
          <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-ohsheglows.png" />
          <p class="p-italic" >Oh She Glows has a great layout that showcases the beautiful food photography taken by Angela Liddon. It has the best consistency in art direction: colorful meals in white serveware with a backdrop of white susrface.</p>
          <p>It does a great job including comprehensive search filters that take audience’s lifestyles into account, such as filtering by dish type, meals, seasons, occasions, time-to-prep, and budget-limit.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Forks Over Knives</h5>
          </div>
          <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-fok.png" />
          <p class="p-italic" >Like Kitchen Stories, the Forks meal planning app  has a tight user flow where a stand-alone article is never more than two levels deep, which eliminates the need for back-buttons to have labels that indicate its destination.</p>
          <p>It does a great job of increasing the discoverability of their content by organizing content into four tabbed-carousel slots that decrease the user's need to scroll for more. Its tab bar navigation is conducive to the multi-tasking required to meal plan.</p>
          <p>It is very thoughtful in its approach to making a grocery list. Users get to choose which recipe ingredients to add to a one-time-use shopping list.</p>
          <a class="link-doc" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Z05Ek3j1l_QaxMnzrQWH1bdNOXXm7hN3OCgdI0txgw/edit?usp=sharing">View the full competitive analysis <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>


          <h2>Defining the target user group</h2>
          <p>Distilling the findings from user research into two personas helped to crystalize the feature set of the MVP. Although both personas have similar motivations, they are different in terms of gender, life stage, and level of cooking expertise.</p>
          <div class="img2upflip-container">

            </div>
          </div>


          <h2>Finalizing the MVP scope</h2>
          <p>I defined the final scope of ingrain’s feature set based on findings from the user research and domain analysis—as well as the overlap of needs between the two personas.</p>
          <p><a class="link-doc" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ODNK6F9b3eQwHQBGkd9tVOcBxkw8ZM6tuds4PS0tySc/edit?usp=sharing">View the complete set of user stories <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p>

          <h2>Message architecture</h2>
          <p>Defining the target user group and the MVP feature scope enables me to refine the ways in which to communicate the product's primary differentiators. By identifying the top product features that add the most value to the user, I was able to create a preliminary skeleton of the page's contents.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Positioning</h5>
          </div>
          <h4>A user-focused meal-planning app from a plant-based perspective—available to users free of charge.</h4>
          <p class="p-italic">A meal-planning tool for those who seek to reverse their chronic diseases by eating a plant-based diet, available free of charge to all who need a soft form of accountability into transition to plant-based, whole-foods eating. Like the Berlin-based Kitchen Stories app, Ingrain will monetize through kitchen product placements.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Value Proposition 1</h5>
          </div>
          <h4>Personalized meal-planning tailored to the user's cuisine preferences and body characteristics.</h4>
          <p class="p-italic">By answering a few questions to create a dietary profile, Ingrain will create daily serving recommendations of plant food groups for the user and suggest recipes that closely match the user's food preferences.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Value Proposition 2</h5>
          </div>
          <h4>Decrease the obstacles to meal-planning as much as possible.</h4>
          <p class="p-italic">Ingrain allows users to adjust serving sizes and quickly add ingredients to a grocery shopping list. It even flags allergens and food dislikes that the user specifies in their dietary profile.</p>


          <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Value Proposition 3</h5>
          </div>
          <h4>Offer a tool to track one’s progress</h4>
          <p class="p-italic">An interactive food tracker allow users to track their progress towards their recommended daily food servings, teaching the user to create balanced, plant-based meals appropriate to their body characteristics, so they can stave off hunger during their transition.</p>


          <h2>Learning from the competition</h2>
          <p>I examined how the four top players in the meal-planning space structure their product pages, among them are Pinto, Forks Over Knives (FoK), ChooseVeg, and 22 Days of Nutrition. Of the four, Pinto and Forks Over Knives had the most compelling landing pages.</p>
          <p>Here is a comparison between Forks Over Knives and Pinto's page structures:</p>
          <div class="img2up-container">
            <div class="img2up">
              <figcaption>Forks Over Knives</figcaption>
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-site/images/pgstruc-fok.svg" />
            </div>
            <div class="img2up">
              <figcaption>Pinto.co</figcaption>
              <img src="assets/csIngrain-site/images/pgstruc-pinto.svg" />
            </div>
          </div>


          <h3>Comparison summary</h3>
          <p>Both FoK and Pinto have an almost 1:1 ratio of  feature set to CTAs, both also concentrated the frequency of CTAs towards the beginning of the product page.</p>
          <p>In terms of navigation, both opted not to have fixed nav-bars despite the length of the product page.</p>


          <h2>Structuring the product page</h2>
          <p>The initial page structure of Ingrain features an almost 1:1 ratio between feature set and CTAs. I opted to remove the recurring CTA of “get our free app” from the page-flow and unto the fixed top navigation bar. This allows me to reduce the number of CTA's throughout the entire product page—giving the featured recipe content all the room to take center stage.</p>


          <div class="img2up-container">
            <div class="img2up">
              <figcaption>Initial page structure</figcaption>

          </div>


          <h2>Designing the skeletons of the page layout</h2>
          <p>Ingrain’s product page comprises of four primary types of layouts: hero, product feature, social proof, and closing hero. Here are the variants considered within each layout type.</p>

          <h2>The origin of the name</h2>
          <p>The name ‘ingrain’ is chosen because its multi-layered associations to plant-based eating.  The word ingrain can be interpreted as ‘ingraining an eating habit in someone.’ It is also a play on the food group ‘grain,’ one of the four plant-based foods.</p>
          <p class="p-italic">Here are a few of the other name alternatives considered:</p>
          <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/ingrainNameAlts.png" />

          <h2>Logo Design</h2>
          <p>The symbol of a mortar and pestle was chosen because it connects the idea of food with medicine. As one of the oldest food-preparation instruments used in cultures from around the globe, it is also used by apotecharies to crush medicinal herbs. From a branding standpoint, it stands out nicely against the logos of competitors that usually highlight familiar cooking or eating utensils.</p>

          <h2>Putting the product page together</h2>
          <p>For the final high-fidelity mock-up of the responsive product page, I went with the minimized-CTA approach and alternated the product feature layout with social proof layout before closing with a strong combination of a user testimonial and the hero animation. </p>
