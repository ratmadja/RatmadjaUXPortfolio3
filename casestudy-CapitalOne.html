          <h4 class="note-label">The Why</h4>
          <h2 class="pullquote">A large part of my work is having the ability to discern where people are struggling, and where people are being excluded from opportunities for a better way to live, work, and play. </h2>
          <p>At a meta-level, here are how I see the purpose of the key initiatives I am presently engaged in at Capital One:</p>

          <h3>Initiative 1</h3>
          <p>The first initiative is about giving our internal Associates back their freedom after being subjected to manual tools that compound error and prevent them from serving the Customer in the way that the Customer would like to receive service. To that end, we are on a journey to build a modern platform and system of record for internal Operations Associates. With each new Operations Team onboarded to this modern platform, we are on a mission to get all of our Associates out of manual excel trackers, and on to a modern platform where they are empowered to better serve the Customer. Additionally, this modernization will allow them to receive the benefits of augmented intelligence in the future.</p>

          <h3>Initiative 2</h3>
          <p>The second initiative is about safeguarding the relationship between Capital One and our valued business partners when it comes to difficult situations where miscommunications arise, and resulted in unmet expectations on both sides. To that end, we are laying the groundwork for a more consistent set of internal operation processes that complements the modern tool we are building for our business customer. The goal is to increase our customer’s perception of the value we deliver in the form of timely and transparent communication—which will strengthen the partnership with our business customers.</p>

          <h3>Initiative 3</h3>
          <p>The third initiative is about empowering our business analysts with a way to ground their strategic recommendations on the latest data we have available, particularly in a fast-moving market environment exacerbated by the Covid19 Pandemic. Presently, our analysts are at the mercy of a time-consuming process of gathering and visualizing data—which meant that their data visualizations are not reflective of the most recent data set. The goal is to build a single source of truth that will enable our analysts to easily access the latest data, visualize data in a way that drives understanding, and ultimately drive confidence in the quality of their strategic recommendation when presenting them before senior leadership.</p>
