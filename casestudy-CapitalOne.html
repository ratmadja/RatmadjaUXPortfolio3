          <h4 class="note-label">The Why</h4>
          <h2 class="pullquote">A large part of my work is having the ability to discern where people are struggling, and where people are being excluded from opportunities for a better way to live, work, and play. </h2>
          <p>At a meta-level, here are how I see the purpose of the key initiatives I am presently engaged in at Capital One:</p>

          <h3>Initiative 1</h3>
          <p>The first initiative is about giving our internal Associates back their freedom after being subjected to manual tools that compound human errors, and make it difficult to serve the Customer in the way that the Customer would like to be served. Our team is on a journey to build a modern platform and system of record for all internal Operations Associates. Ultimately, our intent is to hold the same high bar of quality for the tools we build for our internal Associates, as we do for our external Customers. Additionally, this modernization will position our Associates to reap the benefits of AI and Machine Learning in the future.</p>

          <h3>Initiative 2</h3>
          <p>The second initiative is about safeguarding the relationship between Capital One and our valued Business Customers when it comes to difficult situations where miscommunications arise, and resulted in unmet expectations on both sides. To that end, we are laying the groundwork for a more consistent set of internal processes and procedures that complement the modern tool we are building for our business customer. The goal is to increase our Business Customers' perception of the value that Capital One delivers—which will strengthen the existing partnership.</p>

          <h3>Initiative 3</h3>
          <p>The third initiative is about empowering our business analysts with a better tool to help them make sense of fluctuations in the marketplace, particularly in a fast-moving environment exacerbated by the Covid19 Pandemic. The goal is to build a tool that will enhance the speed of our analysts' work, enhance their throughput with better quality data, and ultimately empower them to secure the confidence of senior leadership when presenting their strategic recommendations.</p>
