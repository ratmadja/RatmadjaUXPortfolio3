        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Ingrain is a plant-based, meal-planning app that was conceived as a response to the diabetes epidemic that is presently ravaging North America. Its purpose is to equip those who often feel as though they’re at the mercy of a chronic disease like diabetes—to reverse their diagnosis with plant-based foods.</p>
        <p class="p-italic">On a personal note—as someone living with Type-2 diabetes, the connection between food and health hits close to home for me. Luckily, my mentor <a class="link-ref" target="_blank" href="http://terrymillion.com/">Terry Million</a> is passionate about this subject as well. I am extremely grateful to him for his encouragement throughout the design process.</p>

        <h3>A case study in three parts</h3>
        <p>I broke down the design process behind Ingrain into three succinct parts. This first part expounds on the competitive analysis and user insights that led me to make several pivots that redefine the MVP.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Why address a diabetes epidemic with a meal planning app? </h2>
        <p>From the start, Ingrain is about drawing the connection between food and medicine. The predominant approach of treating diabetes and other chronic diseases has been to manage rather than reverse the disease. The design of apps for diabetic persons have mirrored this approach by focusing on providing disease-managing tools such as logbooks to monitor blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>Rather than focusing on managing the disease, ingrain focuses on the person by empowering them to eradicate it for good through a diet of plant-based and whole foods.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

      <figcaption>A paradigm shift from simply managing a disease to eradicating the disease</figcaption>
        <p>Rather than providing tools to manage a disease, Ingrain provides the tools to help people heal their bodies by providing free access to high quality recipes that are based on accurate nutrition information and personalizing the meal-planning experience to the user’s needs.</p>
        <p>Ingrain’s plant-based approach to eating builds upon the researches done by American physicians Dr. Rip Esselstyn and Dr. Neal Barnard on preventing and reversing heart diseases and diabetes with plant-based eating (as documented on the Netflix documentary Forks over Knives). As well as Dr. Michael Greger’s research into the harmful effects of consuming animal products.</p>

        <h2>The first pivot</h2>
        <div class="img2upflip-container">
          <div class="img2upflip">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="p-italic">Although Ingrain grew to become a plant-based meal-planning app, it didn’t start out that way. Originally, I set out to design a gamified nutrition education app for youth with diabetes. However, given the time constraint of the project, going through the process of obtaining permission to interview and conduct user-testings prove too significant of a barrier to overcome. At that juncture, I shifted the project scope to be a gamified nutrition education app targeted towards adults ages 18 to 30.</p>

          <h1 class="casestudy-sectionlabel">Validate</h1>
        </div>

        <p>My initial research findings unearthed several insights into the mental model of my target audience, enabling me to form educated assumptions about their attitudes towards healthy-eating. I proceeded to validate these assumptions by deploying a survey to gage the target audience's perception of healthy eating and conducting interviews to assess young adults' attitudes towards the relationship between food and health.</p>

        </div>
        <p>When participants were asked to rank 12 foods in order of health, the top 3 spots are taken by plant-based foods. But the belief that fish and chicken are healthier meats compared to beef  still persists.</p>
        <p>78% consider meals containing meat and carbs as foods to reward themselves with.</p>

        <h2>The second pivot</h2>
        <div class="img2upflip-container">
          <div class="img2upflip">

        <p class="p-italic">After analyzing the results of my user survey and interviews, I realized that no amount of nutrition education will convince an unmotivated or willfully-ignorant person that their poor dietary choices are on a collision course with their health. This insight led me to shift ingrain’s target user group. Instead of trying to convince unmotivated young adults to eat healthily through a gamified nutrition education app— ingrain will instead empower people who have made the decision to transition to plant-based, whole foods.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Meal-planning delivery models</h2>
        <p>I studied several competitors to study how they position themselves in the marketplace and understand their business models.</p>

        <h3>The vertically-integrated meal-delivery kits</h3>
        <p>The first model is that of meal-planning apps that are connected to a vertically-integrated meal kit delivery service. Services such as the ChooseVeg Meal Planner and the Jay-Z & Beyonce-endorsed 22 Days of Nutrition follow this model. They allow users to personalize their meal plans by asking questions about the user’s availability to meal-prep and suggesting recipes that fit their schedule.</p>
        <div class="img2upflip-container">

          </div>
        </div>
        <figcaption>Chooseveg and 22 Days of Nutrition—the vegan vertically-integrated meal kit delivery models</figcaption>

        <h3>The traffic funnels</h3>
        <p>The second model is that of meal-planing apps that function as traffic funnels that direct users towards a brand’s website, usually  to get users to purchase their products or services. A great example is the Forks over Knives’ mealplanner app, which funnels users to the parent site where users can sign up to get certified in plant-based cooking. Oh She Glows is an app that serves as an extension of the author Angela Liddon’s cooking blog, where users can access more recipes and purchase her cookbook.</p>
        <div class="img2upflip-container">
          <div class="img2upflip">

          <div class="img2upflip">
            <img src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor4.png" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <figcaption>Forks Over Knives and Oh-She-Glows—meal-planning apps that function as traffic funnels to the author’s website.</figcaption>

        <h3>The community recipe site</h3>
        <p>A third model focuses on serving the user by providing them with free access to their curated recipe content. Their revenue stream came through product-placement. The result is a crisp, user-focused cooking app that is not trying to sell products to users. The best example of this is the Berlin-based cooking app Kitchen Stories. They offer users free access to its curated recipe content. Giving users ability to save, share, and rate their content gives them useful traffic information and promotes a sense of community among users.</p>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/competitor5.png" />


        <h2>Ingrain can be the “Kitchen Stories from a plant-based perspective.”</h2>
        <p>I then took a closer look at the structure and interface of three apps: Kitchen Stories, Oh She Glows, and the Forks Over Knives Meal Planner app. Here is a breakdown of what each app does best.</p>


        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Kitchen Stories</h5>
        </div>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-ks.png" />
        <p class="p-italic">Kitchen Stories has the cleanest and tightest information architecture that I have ever seen in recipe apps.</p>
        <p>This is accomplished by limiting user engagement with content (e.g. like, save, share) to the smallest unit of information (a recipe article). A featured kitchen story is never more than two levels deep. This allows for that third-level of depth to be occupied by how-to-videos and step-by-step prep instructions.</p>
        <p>It does a great job of encouraging user engagement with content by liking, saving, and commenting—without diluting the consistency of the brand.</p>
        <p>It has a netflix-like approach to presenting content that encourage users to explore and browse recipe content at their pace.</p>

        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Oh She Glows</h5>
        </div>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-ohsheglows.png" />
        <p class="p-italic" >Oh She Glows has a great layout that showcases the beautiful food photography taken by Angela Liddon. It has the best consistency in art direction: colorful meals in white serveware with a backdrop of white susrface.</p>
        <p>It does a great job including comprehensive search filters that take audience’s lifestyles into account, such as filtering by dish type, meals, seasons, occasions, time-to-prep, and budget-limit.</p>

        <div class="caption-fullwidth-container">
            <h5 class="caption-fullwidth">Forks Over Knives</h5>
        </div>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/screens-fok.png" />
        <p class="p-italic" >Like Kitchen Stories, the Forks meal planning app  has a tight user flow where a stand-alone article is never more than two levels deep, which eliminates the need for back-buttons to have labels that indicate its destination.</p>
        <p>It does a great job of increasing the discoverability of their content by organizing content into four tabbed-carousel slots that decrease the user's need to scroll for more. Its tab bar navigation is conducive to the multi-tasking required to meal plan.</p>
        <p>It is very thoughtful in its approach to making a grocery list. Users get to choose which recipe ingredients to add to a one-time-use shopping list.</p>

        <h2>The user personas</h2>
        <p>Distilling the findings from user research into two personas helped to narrow down the feature set of the MVP. Although both personas have similar motivations, they are different in terms of gender, life stage, and level of cooking expertise.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Defining the scope of the MVP</h2>
        <p>I defined the final scope of ingrain’s feature set based on findings from the user research and domain analysis—as well as the overlap of needs between the two personas.</p>
        <p><a class="link-doc" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ODNK6F9b3eQwHQBGkd9tVOcBxkw8ZM6tuds4PS0tySc/edit?usp=sharing">View the complete user stories <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a></p>

        <h2>The origin of the name Ingrain</h2>
        <p class="p-italic">The name ‘ingrain’ is chosen because its multi-layered associations to plant-based eating.  The word ingrain can be interpreted as ‘ingraining an eating habit in someone.’ It is also a play on the food group ‘grain,’ one of the four plant-based foods.</p>
        <p class="p-italic">Here are a few of the name alternatives considered:</p>
        <img class="img-fullwidth" src="assets/csIngrain-strategy/images/ingrainNameAlts.png" />

        <h2>The beginnings of a structure</h2>
        <p>My user flows gave me a starting point to begin to visualize the screen app interface. Later on, sketching the screens by hand helped me to challenge my initial ideas and discover ways of simplifying the user flow.</p>
        <div class="img2upflip-container">

        </div>
        <figcaption>Early user flows of onboarding (left), and recipe browsing (right).</figcaption>
        <p>Sketching visual representations of my initial user flows opened possiblities of simplifying the user’s navigation path from top level content to other content that are several levels deep, and back again.</p>
        <p>I learned that the secret to a clean, tight user flow in a primarily content-driven app is to limit user engagement to the smallest unit of information. In the case of ingrain, it was the individual recipe articles. Once I isolated the location where users are able to favorite, save, and rate the content, my user flows became much less convoluted.</p>
