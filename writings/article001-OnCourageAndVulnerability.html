        <h2 class="pullquote">“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved more than you’ll ever know.”—A.A. Milne</h2>
        <p>I believe that taking the risk to show up consistently in an area where I had little control over the outcome have been moments of courage in my life. At the same time, I have to say that they were also moments of vulnerability. This is an account of the time when leaning into vulnerability became an unexpected form of bravery for me. To tell this story, I will recount one of the most uncertain time periods in my life, which came when I tried to transition to a different professional career at the age of 31.</p>

          <h2>Into the Unknown</h2>
          <p>I had quit the field of architecture to try two different professions that I soon learned were not sustainable for me. After a brief return to the world of architecture that confirmed my initial decision to leave it in the first place, I was back at the drawing board to figure out what I should be doing for a living.</p>
          <p>By that time, I was very disheartened. A year spent making two unsuccessful attempts to transition careers had all but eroded my confidence. I felt too paralyzed to make a third attempt at a different profession. I believed that after two tries, I had no more room for error. I told myself, “You’ve failed twice, so a third failure is not an option.” Unsurprisingly, this mindset resulted in my being very risk-averse in my career search. In evaluating potential careers, I devoted my attention almost exclusively to the risks involved should it not work out like the last two.</p>
          <p>It was my mom who pushed me to give Interaction Design (UX) a chance. She said there is always a risk that things may not work out, but there is also a chance that things will work out. Her advice to focus on the rewards and positive outcomes that lie on the other side of risk-taking was the beginning of my shift towards a growth mindset.</h2>
          <p>Standing at the crossroads, I was caught between the weight of my two past attempts that ended in failure, and the uncertain future of making a third attempt.</p>
          <h2 class="pullquote">There comes a moment when the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of braving the risk into the unknown—and this was that moment for me.</h2>
          <p>My friends and family had opened the door for me to give a good outcome as much of a chance of happening as a bad outcome. And so with their love and support, I began a formal apprenticeship in interaction design.</p>



          <h2>The Beauty in Uncertainty</h2>
          <p>My interaction design apprenticeship lasted for about a year. For almost every day during that year, I showed up at a local coffee shop named Canabru, where I would log “study shifts” of eight or more hours to learn a new discipline while battling anxiety. Looking back, every day was an exercise of faith because there was no guarantee that studying for 48 hours a week will materialize into a future career.</p>
          <p>As I progressed in my interaction design apprenticeship, I began to focus on what I can do in the present to set myself up for success instead of worrying about the future. I also counted my blessings in that I had enough personal savings to give undivided attention to this effort. I also got to study with my best friend, who was working towards her doctor of optometry degree at the time.</p>
          <p>I did not realize it then, but in that consistent daily action of showing up and being fully present to learn a new discipline, I was building the skill to operate effectively in areas of life and work where there is high ambiguity and high risk. Later on, I would come to lean on that skill as an Interaction Designer. To my surprise, I began to trust myself again. My confidence also grew when I realized that I had taught myself enough frontend coding languages to be dangerous.</p>


          <h2>An Unexpected Form of Bravery</h2>
          <p>A year passed by, and I was proud to have completed my final project, designed my portfolio website, and built said website from scratch. I put the finishing touch on my resume and began an earnest job search. The most exciting moment came when I was invited to the final round of interviews for an Interaction Designer position by two great companies.</p>
          <p>Truthfully, I was both ecstatic and apprehensive at the same time. I knew I could end up with two offers, one offer, or none. It was as scary as it gets—to be so close to the finish line, and yet be so aware that I may trip at the last minute and end up with nothing to show for all my efforts.In that vulnerable moment, I chose to respond differently than I had in my entire life.</p>

          <h2 class="pullquote">Instead of waiting for the official job offer letter to celebrate, I chose to celebrate myself regardless of the outcome of my efforts.</h2>
          <p>I realized that it was important that I recognize myself for the courage it took to leave a familiar profession, and move towards a new profession where l will have the opportunity to make a difference at a scale I can only dream of. And so I bought myself a simple ring before going into the two final interviews. That ring became a personal reminder to value myself and believe in my potential regardless of the outcome of my risk-taking, and independently of what skills I bring to the table.</p>


          <p>Happily, I ended up receiving offers from both companies, but it could have just as easily gone the other way. I was building the habit of rewarding myself for having the courage to take risks towards a goal, instead of just rewarding myself when a goal is reached. </p>
          <h2 class="pullquote">Today, I make it a practice to reward myself for moments when I am taking risks instead of moments where my risk-taking pays off.</h2>
          <p>In doing so, I am building a reserve of unconditional regard for myself to sustain the courage to show up and be fully present in areas of life where there is high ambiguity, and little promise of reward. This experience has taught me that leaning into vulnerability is a form of courage when one is facing the unknown.</p>
          <p>It turns out that I am braver than I believed. </p>
